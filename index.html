        <h3> Me </h3>
        
        <p>I am a student at Glendale Community College transferring to a UC(still determining what university I will attend in the fall). My accepted major is physics, with a plan to continue computer science development. 
        </p>
        <p>
           I have a strong interest in high energy and nuclear physics. As an undergraduate student I have been involved in research opportunities that covered a broad group of topics relating to astrophysics. I plan to attend graduate school in physics after my undergraduate career. 
        </p>
        <p> In any free time I enjoy developing iOS applications. I have yet to publish anything to the App Store, but have developed a couple of hobby apps.
